# uncommon-dylan

The `uncommon-utils` module is a playground for experimental Dylan
utilities and the `uncommon-dylan` module is like `common-dylan`
except that it renames various definitions, for example `<integer>` ->
`<int>`. This is an attempt to make Dylan code slightly less verbose
without loss of readability.
