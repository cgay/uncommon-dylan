# uncommon-dylan

The `uncommon-dylan` module is like `common-dylan` except that it renames
various definitions for brevity. `<int>` instead of `<integer>` etc.

The `uncommon-utils` module is for things that wouldn't make sense to go in the
core language.  The distinction is probably a bit arbitrary.

These will only be used in projects whose primary home is my own github
repository, not dylan-lang projects.
